This is a perpetual twelve month calendar.
It can show the previous month, the current month, and the ten months from the current month.

The calendar starts from the current date based on the system clock.

Events populate the corresponding date, based on the position of the element in the month array.

New Year holidays, Easter, birthday of the reigning Sovereign, Labour Day, Anzac Day, Christmas and Boxing days, are automatically added by the script.

Regional New Zealand holidays are fully listed in the application.

Matariki, the celebration of a star cluster rising, marks the beginning of the new year in the MƒÅori lunar calendar.
Matariki is set from the years 2022 to 2035.

Daylight saving start and end dates are listed in the calendar.

I was confronted with some known quirks with the Date API (Application Processing Interface).
This was a great opportunity to debug and figure out a way to make the application work.
